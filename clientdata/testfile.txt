The first command, “create”, is to help Ken create a file on the server, where the third
parameter gives the file’s permissions (‘r’ and ‘w’ respectively represent reading and
writing permissions, while ‘-’ indicates no permission). The second command, “read”,
allows Ken to download the file from the server (only when he has the corresponding
permission and the file does exist). The third command, “write”, allows Ken to upload (and revise) an existing file, where the third parameter can be either ‘o’ or ‘a’, which
allows Ken to either overwrite the original file or append his data in the end of the file,
respectively. Similarly, Ken can write the file if he has the corresponding permission
and the file does exist. The last command, “changemode”, is used to modify the file’s
permissions. The revised permissions take effect for the following operations after the
change command. Notice that all clients operate the files in the same directory on the
server side. The server must use CAPABILITY LISTS to manage the permissions of
files. You have to show TAs how the capability lists change for each operation on
the server side.The first command, “create”, is to help Ken create a file on the server, where the third
